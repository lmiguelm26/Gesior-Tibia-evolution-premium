## Gesior - AAC

### Requirements:
* [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) with [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html) enabled + [PHP](http://php.net) Version 5.6 or newer

### How to install:
* Clone the Gesior-ACC From GitHub.
* change the permission for write in /cache.

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /cache
```

### Tips and Tricks:
* This website have some security implements, here you can use apache2 to apply them.
* run these commands to maximize your security.
````bash
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod rewrite 
````
* on ubuntu 16.06 or 14.04 go to apache folder and edit your config.
* run:
````bash
sudo vim /etc/apache2/apache2.conf 
````
and search for something like this: 
```markdown
<Directory PATH_TO_YOUR_WEBSITE>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted         
</Directory>
```

* and add something like this /\

### PHP NEEDS THAT FOLLOWING
```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-gd
sudo apt-get install php5-curl
```

Make sure curl is enabled in the php.ini file. For me it's in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini, if you can't find it, this line might be in /etc/php5/conf.d/curl.ini. Make sure the line :
extension=curl.so

now restart apache.:
```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```
or
```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### FOR UBUNTU ACCOUNTING PROBLEMS
If you have trouble registering using ubuntu or any other version of php where the site claims to have registered but was not done, simply run the following command on your database:
```bash
SET GLOBAL sql_mode = '';
```
